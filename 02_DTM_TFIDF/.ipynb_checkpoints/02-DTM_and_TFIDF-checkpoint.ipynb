    "How to find distinctive words in a corpus is a long-standing question in text analysis. Today, we'll learn one simple approach to this: TF-IDF. The idea behind words scores is to weight words not just by their frequency, but by their frequency in one document compared to their distribution across all documents. Words that are frequent, but are also used in every single document, will not be distinguising. We want to identify words that are unevenly distributed across the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most popular ways to weight words (beyond frequency counts) is `tf-idf score`. By offsetting the frequency of a word by its document frequency (the number of documents in which it appears) will in theory filter out common terms such as 'the', 'of', and 'and'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, the *inverse document frequency* of word $j$ is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$idf_{j} = log\\left(\\frac{\\#docs}{\\#docs\\,with\\,j}\\right)$ \n",
    "\n",
    "and the *term freqency - inverse document frequency* is \n",
    "\n",
    "$tfidf_{ij} = f_{ij}\\times{idf_j}$ where $f_{ij}$ is the number of occurences of word $j$ in document $i$.\n",

    "\n",
    "$tfidf_{ij} = \\frac{f_{ij}}{\\#words\\,in\\,doc\\,i}\\times{idf_{j}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can calculate this manually, but scikit-learn has a built-in function to do so. This function also uses log frequencies, so the numbers will not correspond excactly to the calculations above. We'll use the [scikit-learn calculation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html), but a challenge for you: use Pandas to calculate this manually. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "Consider a document containing 100 words wherein the word cat appears 3 times. \n",
    "- The term frequency (i.e., tf) for cat is then (3 / 100) = 0.03. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, assume we have 10 million documents and the word cat appears in one thousand of these. \n",
    "- Then, the inverse document frequency (i.e., idf) is calculated as log(10,000,000 / 1,000) = 4. \n",
